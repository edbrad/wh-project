**New EMS Warehouse Project**

This Repository is used to document the research and development work performed over the course of building and deploying a new *Warehouse Management System** (**wh**) for Executive Mailing Service.

## Overview:
Executive Mailing Service currently uses a pair of custom **ACCESS 97** Database applications (waresys.mdb & tracking.mdb) to manage mail-piece component inventory (Outer Envelopes, Forms, Inserts, Stickers, etc...).  The origins of these applications date back to the early years of the company (1980's).  It has served its purpose over the years but an overhaul/replacement of the system is desparately needed:

* The landscape of Direct Mail has changed dramatically in the last 15 years: Technology has become a much larger part of producing and managing Direct Mail campaigns and projects. Direct Mail service companys must be more agile and tech-savvy to meet the needs of today's Direct Mail client.  

* In the wake of the *"Great Recession"*, the client list for Executive Mailing Service has changed: Through the 90's and early 2000's, EMS served a small list of high-volume mailing clients, primarily from the financial sector (which greatly reduced and consolidarted mail .  Mailing projects and related jobs were relatively simple, with few variations.  Around 2009, EMS began taking on more Non-Profit mailing projects. Today's Direct Mail Campaigns are typically much more complex.  With a significantly larger client base and more jobs in production, the amount of stock components to manage increased greatly. With the increase, managing stock with current applications has become very problematic.  With the giant increase in unique component codes to manage, there are often issues with lost and/or misplaced stock.  

There are some "off the shelf" solutions available. However, there is no money available to invest in any of them.  Therefore, we are forced to address this issue by developing a solution internally.  There are many viable Open-Source tools available that can be used to build a modern Warehouse Management System that is customized to the EMS environment.
